<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->

### Game Instructions

- Its a two player game.
- The first player gets the X symbol and O is reserved for the second player.
- Each player takes turns by choosing row and column.
- You should enter row and columns with a space in between for example: "1 1"
- The first player to place their symbol three in a row wins the game.
- The game is declared draw if all the nine cells of the board is filled and no player managed to place their three in a row.
- Visit this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Wikipedia page</a> to learn more.

The layout of the positions are as follows:

  0 0 | 0 1 | 0 2<br /> 
  ---+----+---<br /> 
  1 0 | 1 1 | 1 2<br /> 
  ---+----+---<br /> 
  2 0 | 2 1 | 2 2
